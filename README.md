As a patient, I must be able to see the availability of the doctors and schedule an appointment for myself.
- Get Doctors Availability (GET /ap1/v1/agendas/search)

As a doctor, I must be able to see the appointments that I have for a given time period.
- Search Appointments for the given criterias (GET /ap1/v1/appointments/search)

As a doctor, I can set my self as unavailable for a specific time period. blocking any patients from scheduling an appointment for that period. (e.g., doctor can be on vacation, sick, etcâ€¦)
